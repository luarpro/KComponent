KComponent
==========

Existing popular AIR mobile component is Feathers UI based on Starling framework. In old phone model, e.g. iPhone3GS. Starling framework cause the app launch time extremely long. Therefore, I develop a lightweight AIR Mobile Component from scratch, without based on stage3D, you can use in any phone model or platform. 

The Only Objective:
* lightweight and launch fast

Because it is lightweight but customizable, it does not provide UI redraw automatically. If you have made any change on UI, you have to redraw UI manually.
